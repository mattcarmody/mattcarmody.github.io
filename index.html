    <h1>Matt Carmody</h1>
    <p>Hi, I'm Matt. I'm an engineer, traveler, climber, reader, tinkerer and apsiring polyglot. I value curiousity, resilience and flexibility. While I know that specialization is the path to financial success, I can't help studying a wide range of topics. It's too much fun.</p>
    <p>I'm a Midwestern American, born and raised in the suburbs of Chicago, and I now live in Denver. I'm a native English speaker, conversational Portuguese speaker and beginner Spanish speaker.</p>
    
    <!-- Why Software?
    <p>I'm a mechanical engineer learning to develop software. I'm drawn by how quickly an idea can become reality in the digital world and the wealth of resources that are accessible for self teaching. There are lifetimes worth of learning at our fingertips!</p>
    <p>And I'm drawn because information has gone digital. I love to break down a conceptual knot or gray area, untangle the threads and piece it together as simply as possible. If information is in the digital world, that's where I want to direct my efforts.</p>
    <p>With digital information comes digital tools that enhance our decision making, which is where my focus has been of late. As I've been learning about software development, I've been building projects that fall under the thematic umbrella of leveraging data to help me make smarter decisions. If I can make tools that help the manager side of myself better lead the worker part of myself, it's a valuable use of my time. If I can automate it, it's gold.</p>
