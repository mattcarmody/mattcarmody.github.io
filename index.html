    <h1>Matt Carmody</h1>
    <p>Hi, I'm Matt. I'm an engineer, traveler, climber, reader, tinkerer and apsiring polyglot. I value curiousity, resilience and flexibility. While I know that specialization is the path to financial success, I can't help studying a wide range of topics. It's too much fun!</p>
    <p>I'm a Midwestern American, born and raised in the suburbs of Chicago. I graduated with a BS in Engineering Mechanics from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and worked as an ME co-op and product engineer at Panduit Corp. for two to three years. I then spent the better part of two years backpacking around the world, at times with friends though mostly solo. I trekked to Everest Base Camp in Nepal, sailed on the Puget Sound in Olympia and danced samba in Rio de Janeiro, among so much more! After returning home I learned to program using Python and basic web development w/ HTML, CSS & Javascript. I'm a native English speaker, developed conversational Portuguese in Brazil and accumulated survival Spanish in Spain, Nicaragua & Argentina. I now live in Denver.</p>
    
    <!-- Why Software?
    <p>I'm a mechanical engineer learning to develop software. I'm drawn by how quickly an idea can become reality in the digital world and the wealth of resources that are accessible for self teaching. There are lifetimes worth of learning at our fingertips!</p>
    <p>And I'm drawn because information has gone digital. I love to break down a conceptual knot or gray area, untangle the threads and piece it together as simply as possible. If information is in the digital world, that's where I want to direct my efforts.</p>
    <p>With digital information comes digital tools that enhance our decision making, which is where my focus has been of late. As I've been learning about software development, I've been building projects that fall under the thematic umbrella of leveraging data to help me make smarter decisions. If I can make tools that help the manager side of myself better lead the worker part of myself, it's a valuable use of my time. If I can automate it, it's gold.</p>
