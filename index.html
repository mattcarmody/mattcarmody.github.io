    <h1>Matt Carmody</h1>
    <p>Hi, I'm Matt. I'm an engineer, traveler, climber, reader, tinkerer and apsiring polyglot. I value curiousity, resilience and flexibility. While I know that specialization is the path to financial success, I can't help studying a wide range of topics. It's too much fun.</p>
    <p>I'm a Midwestern American, born and raised in the suburbs of Chicago, and I now live in Denver. I'm a native English speaker, conversational Portuguese speaker and beginner Spanish speaker.</p>
    
    <!-- Why Software?
    <p>I'm a mechanical engineer learning to develop software. I'm drawn by how quickly an idea can become reality in the digital world and the wealth of resources that are accessible for self teaching. There are lifetimes worth of learning at our fingertips!</p>
    <p>And I'm drawn because information has gone digital. I love to break down a conceptual knot or gray area, untangle the threads and piece it together as simply as possible. If information is in the digital world, that's where I want to direct my efforts.</p>
    <p>With digital information comes digital tools that enhance our decision making, which is where my focus has been of late. As I've been learning about software development, I've been building projects that fall under the thematic umbrella of leveraging data to help me make smarter decisions. If I can make tools that help the manager side of myself better lead the worker part of myself, it's a valuable use of my time. If I can automate it, it's gold.</p>

    <h3>Now</h3>
    <p>I moved to Denver! Now I'm closer to beautiful landscape and I'm building a new life in a new place. I've moved out of my car and into a house in Washington Park where a friend lives and a bedroom opened up suddenly.</p>
    <p>I started working part time at a hostel, creating the experiences for others that I enjoyed so much over the last few years. In the less exciting moments when I'm cleaning and folding linens, I listen to podcasts and stories in Spanish & Portuguese, which I continue to study.</p>
    <p>I'm putting a lot of time into my body with a focus on mobility, having strength through a range of motion, and bodyweight strength. I've been practicing at Anytime Fitness and now in my enormous bedroom where I have plenty of space to exercise, though not quite enough height for handstand training. I expect to soon join Movement Climbing & Fitness, as well as Awaken Gym.</p>
    <!-- <p>I'm reading a bit less than I'm used to, as the books are best read in small bits at a time with reflection in between sessions. It's no coincidence that I'm walking more.</p> -->
    <p>I'm still filling out 'professional' job applications, but not many. I'm happy at the hostel and don't want to leave it for a full time engineering job at the moment. Hopefully I'll be able to build up my skillset to the point where I can take on some part time or freelance programming work and start building up experience.</p>
    
    <h3>Projects</h3>
    <h5>Trackr</h5>
    <p>In the process of learning Python, I've been creating a "trackr" that monitors my day to day learning progress. It was entirely automated and all data was stored in a spreadsheet, showing me my quantified activity on sites I frequent for language learning, coding exercises and reading. I've since moved it to SQLite and added aspects of my physical activity, which require that I dictate an email with my activity to a dedicated email address. As I write this I'm in the process of creating automated visuals of my progress on a weekly, monthly, quarterly and annual basis, each with it's own scope that helps me plan the upcoming interval. The hope is to make it a web app and tie it into this site, though at this point I have no exposure to Python web frameworks and what wil be involved in that undertaking. (I'm using it as an opportunity to learn about Python web frameworks, not because they're necessarily the best tool for this job.) It could very well continue developing into a more extensive dashboard that pulls disparate elements of my life into one place and helps me stay on track.</p>
    <h5>Personal Site</h5>
    <p>I dabbled in web development on and off over the past four or five years, but I didn't build any projects that are still online. Now I'm happily dusting off the cobwebs and taking the opportunity to create a digital presence for myself. A place people can check in on me, see what I'm working on or learn a bit about my backstory. Tell me what you think of this site!</p>
    <h5>Warm Up Quiz</h5>
    <p>Though it was started first, this been largely sidelined by Trackr as far as where my attention goes lately. It's a bit of a meta project, a Python based script that quizzes me on Python concepts. It takes into account how well I understand each concept and when I last saw it, choosing quiz material accordingly. It's waiting for me to layout a more consistent set of data tables, complete the move from a spreadsheet to a database, potentially move from the terminal to a GUI, and expand the quiz material by scraping the  Python docs. Once it is functional with a thorough set of Python material, it can be expanded to other topics.</p>
    <h5>Unbundled Fares</h5>
    <p>I love traveling and doing more with less. The merging of those two in the form of budget airlines has always appealed to me and I've been a happy customer for some time. I never found a thorough resource on the subject though, outside of a mess of outdated, click-bait blog posts. Nothing I could recommend to people who would ask me if I had any recommendations when it came to flying them. So I made one. Now I get to read a lot about a subject I love, filter out the pulp and train my thinking through writing! It's a lot of fun, but it's not being allocated a lot of time at the moment while I put the majority of my focus into the development projects above.</p>
