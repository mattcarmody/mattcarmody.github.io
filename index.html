    <h1>Matt Carmody</h1>
    <p>Hi, I'm Matt. I'm an engineer, climber, reader and all around tinkerer.
    I value curiosity, resilience and flexibility.
    I spend a lot of time in the world of software, where I value well documented, reliable FOSS.</p>
    <p>I grew up in the Midwest, studied Engineering Mechanics, worked as a mechanical engineer then spent a couple years traveling.
    I taught myself computer programming along the way and now work as a software developer in Denver.</p>
    
    <!-- Why Software?
    <p>I'm a mechanical engineer learning to develop software. I'm drawn by how quickly an idea can become reality in the digital world and the wealth of resources that are accessible for self teaching. There are lifetimes worth of learning at our fingertips!</p>
    <p>And I'm drawn because information has gone digital. I love to break down a conceptual knot or gray area, untangle the threads and piece it together as simply as possible. If information is in the digital world, that's where I want to direct my efforts.</p>
    <p>With digital information comes digital tools that enhance our decision making, which is where my focus has been of late. As I've been learning about software development, I've been building projects that fall under the thematic umbrella of leveraging data to help me make smarter decisions. If I can make tools that help the manager side of myself better lead the worker part of myself, it's a valuable use of my time. If I can automate it, it's gold.</p>
