    <h1>Language Studies</h1>
    <p>In recent years, I've caught onto the joy of language learning. Connecting across cultures and thinking in another language have been a source of internal growth and shifted my own perspectives. Right now I'm working to hone my Portuguese and develop my Spanish.</p>

            <h5>Portuguese - Conversational</h5>
            <p>I spent five months in Brazil, three of which were spent staying with Brazilian families. It took longer than expected and was frustrating at times, but I eventually built up to conversational Portuguese, though group settings are still incredibly difficult. With a beautiful sound and cadence, I love speaking Portuguese whenever I have a chance. I'm hunting for friends in Denver that are interested in conversing with me!</p>
            
            <h5>Spanish - Survival</h5>
            <p>I studied Spanish in school but never embraced the subject or applied what I learned. I revisited the language before my travels to Spain, Nicaragua and Argentina but wasn't up to converational level in time. I've continued studying since and I'm now focused on shifting my studies from Duolingo to conversation.</p>
            
            <h5>Esperanto - Beginner</h5>
            <p>It's simple, it's logical, it's fun! I'm obsessed with the idea of Esperanto and it's logical construction. I started studying with Duolingo and YouTube videos last year but decided to put it on hold because I was spreading myself too thin.</p>
