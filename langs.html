    <h1>Language Studies</h1>
    <p>In recent years, I've caught the joy of language learning.
    Connecting across cultures and thinking in another language have been a source of internal growth and shifted perspectives.
    Right now I'm working to expand my Portuguese and develop my Spanish.</p>

            <h5>Portuguese - Conversational</h5>
            <p>I've spent nearly a year in Brazil, often staying with Brazilian families.
            It took longer than expected and was frustrating at times, but I eventually built up to conversational Portuguese.
            With a beautiful sound and cadence, I love speaking Portuguese whenever I get the chance.
            <br>
            These days my studies center around my daily Anki reviews.
            Every week or two I find new Anki material by reading books or BBC articles.</p>
            
            <h5>Spanish - Advanced Beginner</h5>
            <p>I studied Spanish in junior high and high school but never really embraced the subject or applied what I learned.
            I revisited the language before my travels to Spain, Nicaragua and Argentina but the conversations I had depended on a <i>very</i> patient partner.
            <br>
            I've revived my studies, with a focus on listening comprehension.
            I review Anki audio cards daily and I'm exploring how best to approach learning Spanish through Portuguese.</p>
            
            <h5>Esperanto - Beginner</h5>
            <p>It's simple, it's logical, it's fun!
            I love the idea of Esperanto and it's logical construction.
            I started studying a while back but decided to put it on hold because I was spreading myself too thin.</p>

            <h3>Recommended Resources</h3>
            <h5><a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a></h5>
            <p>I recommend this over all over resources. It is the core of my language studies.
            Anki is a spaced-repetition flashcard program that tracks what you know and shows you the cards at just the right time.
            It's the best memory tool I've used and I use it for languages, programming and miscellaneous knowledge.
            Anyone who's been to med school probably knows it.</p>
            <h5><a href="https://www.duolingo.com/">Duolingo</a></h5>
            <p>It's a good starting point if you don't want to pay but if you're serious about learning a language I don't think it should be your main practice source.
            I recommend starting with it and pairing it with a spaced repetition software like Anki to retain the knowledge you pick up.
            Once you've gotten through the basics, if you're serious about continuing, buy Fluent Forever.</p>
            <h5><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19661852-fluent-forever">Fluent Forever (book)</a></h5>
            <p>A thorough guide to shape your approach to language learning.
            I also recommend his minimal pair trainers, Anki decks for sale that help shape your hearing and pronunciation.</p>
            <h5><a href="https://www.tandem.net/">Tandem</a></h5>
            <p>Books and apps are the training they provide is important, but the real goal is usually conversation.
            There is no substitute for actually talking to people.
            Tandem is a language exchange app to meet people who know the language you're seeking and vice versa.
            It's a good resource if there isn't a local scene to practice your target language.</p>
            <h5><a href="http://ielanguages.com/">IE Languages</a></h5>
            <p>A cool resource that shows similar languages side by side.
            For example: English, Spanish, Portuguese, French and Italian vocabulary are in a single table with toggles for each language.
            I haven't really used it yet, I just find it satisfying to browse.</p>
