        <h5>Slipstream - <a href="https://github.com/BruceDLong/CodeDog">GitHub repo</a></h5>
        <p>
            I'm one of three core Slipstream developers.
            I write core functionality of the CodeDog platform, contribute to the Proteus engine and drive documentation for the project.

        <h5>Pyparsing, a Python package - <a href="https://github.com/pyparsing/pyparsing">GitHub repo</a></h5>
        <p>
            pyparsing is a Python package for constructing a parser, used in ~140k GitHub repositories.
            I contribute unit tests and documentation to the project.

        <h5>Anki</h5>
        <p>
            Anki is a spaced repetition software (a memory tool) that I use every day.
            It's FOSS with an extensive community of add-ons that extend the base software.
            Recently, I've been contributing documentation for various add-ons.
            I'm also in the process of taking over as maintainer of a handful of add-ons.

        <h5><a href="https://mattcarmody.github.io/">Personal Site</a></h5>
        <p>Web development isn't an area I've invested a great deal of time in, but I enjoy tinkering with this site.</p>

    <div class="project">
        <h5>Trackr - <a href="https://github.com/mattcarmody/trackr">Github repo</a></h5>
        <p>In the process of learning Python, I've been creating a "trackr" that monitors my day to day learning progress. It was entirely automated and all data was stored in a spreadsheet, showing me my quantified activity on sites I frequent for language learning, coding exercises and reading. I've since moved it to SQLite and added aspects of my physical activity, which require that I dictate an email with my activity to a dedicated email address. As I write this I'm in the process of creating automated visuals of my progress on a weekly, monthly, quarterly and annual basis, each with it's own scope that helps me plan the upcoming interval. The hope is to make it a web app and tie it into this site, though at this point I have no exposure to Python web frameworks and what wil be involved in that undertaking. (I'm using it as an opportunity to learn about Python web frameworks, not because they're necessarily the best tool for this job.) It could very well continue developing into a more extensive dashboard that pulls disparate elements of my life into one place and helps me stay on track.</p>

    <div class="project">
        <h5>Warm Up Quiz - <a href="https://github.com/mattcarmody/Warm-Up-Quiz">Github repo</a></h5>
        <p>Though it was started first, this been largely sidelined by Trackr as far as where my attention goes lately. It's a bit of a meta project, a Python based script that quizzes me on Python concepts. It takes into account how well I understand each concept and when I last saw it, choosing quiz material accordingly. It's waiting for me to layout a more consistent set of data tables, complete the move from a spreadsheet to a database, potentially move from the terminal to a GUI, and expand the quiz material by scraping the  Python docs. Once it is functional with a thorough set of Python material, it can be expanded to other topics.</p>
