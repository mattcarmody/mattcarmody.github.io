    <h3>Now</h3>
    <p><em>April 6, 2020</em></p>
    <p>A day in the life in quarentine:<br>
    Wake up, usually later than I'd like.
    Review my Anki cards for the day.
    Do some programming.
    Take a break to go for a run.
    Program again.
    A bit of reddit.
    Read a book, maybe watch an episode of Better Call Saul.
    That's about it.</p>
    <h3>Programming</h3>
    <p>Working on Slipstream from home, developing the Windows platform.
    Contributing unit tests to pyparsing.
    Revising documentation for various Anki add-ons.</p>
    <h3>Running</h3>
    <p>It's a slow, steady process building back up from nothing.
    I zig-zag around the neighborhood with the park and trails a bit crowded, usually 3-4 miles every other day.
    I'm not timing myself but I can feel my pace increasing.
    On off days I walk instead.</p>
    <h3>Reading</h3>
    <p>The Wheel of Time rolls on, four books in.
    It may have to wait for the library to reopen, tablet reading doesn't set me up well for sleep.
    I'm taking a break from the series to explore one of Donna Tartt's works.</p>
