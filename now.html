    <h3>Now</h3>
    <p><em>April 6, 2020</em></p>
    <p>A day in the life in quarentine.
    Wake up, usually later than I'd like.
    Review my Anki cards for the day. Do some programming. Take a break to go for a run. Program again. Read a book, maybe watch an episode of Better Call Saul. That's about it.</p>
    <p>I've scaled back to <a href="/threepursuits.html">three pursuits</a>: programming, running and reading. I'm trying to consistently say no to things that don't align with these three pursuits. The focus is on consistency rather than intensity.</p>
    <h3>Programming</h3>
    <p>Working on Slipstream from home, developing the Windows platform. Contributing unit tests to pyparsing and revising documentation for various Anki add-ons.</p>
    <h3>Climbing</h3>
    <p>Climbing encapsulates just about everything I want to do with my body. Strength, flexibility, balance, coordination, light bodyweight. It all makes a difference. So I try to climb 3 times a week, do pushing exercises 3 times a week, and lightly stretch on a rest day. I spent a ton of time outdoors this past week with a good friend in town, we crushed a lot of routes in Clear Creek Canyon and at Movement! I matched by personal best on outdoor lead (5.11a - onsight!) and indoor top rope (5.12a - onsight!).</p>
    <h3>Portuguese</h3>
    <p>I continue to practice daily on Duolingo and now I'm sending occasional voice messages back and forth with friends in Brazil. I'm also reading some Portuguese Wikipedia articles and adding words to an Anki deck. It would probably be worth buying the Anki iPhone app so I can study those on my commute...</p>
