    <h3>Now</h3>
    <p><em>May 4, 2020</em></p>
    <p>A weekday in the life in quarantine:<br>
    Wake up, usually later than I'd like.
    Review my Anki cards for the day.
    Do some programming, lately I've been focused on improving my Java.
    Take a break to get outside.
    Program again.
    A lot of Dominion in the evening, I'm hooked!
    Read a book or maybe watch a movie. I've been working through the MCU lately.
    That's about it.</p>
    <h3>Programming</h3>
    <p>Preparing for a new opportunity! It looks like Java Full Stack is in my future, so working on building that skill set.
    Contributing unit tests to pyparsing on hold until my last PR is reviewed.
    Writing the documentation for ImageResizer, an Anki add-on.
    Revising documentation for various Anki add-ons.
    </p>
    <h3>Running</h3>
    <p>It's a slow, steady process building back up from nothing.
    I zig-zag around the neighborhood with the park and trails a bit crowded, usually 3-4 miles every other day.
    I'm not timing myself but I can feel my pace increasing.
    On off days I walk and stretch.
    I felt pain in my leg yesterday, so taking a couple days off.</p>
    <h3>Reading</h3>
    <p>The Wheel of Time rolls on, four books in.
    Last week I enjoyed a couple Justin Halpern books. It was nice to relax and have a few sorely needed laughs.
    Now I'm back onto Wheel of Time book 5!</p>
