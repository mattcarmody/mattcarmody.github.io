    <h3>Now</h3>
    <p><em>March 24, 2018</em></p>
    <p>I moved to Denver! Now I'm closer to beautiful landscape and I'm building a new life in a new place. I've moved out of my car and into a house in Washington Park where a friend lives and a bedroom opened up suddenly.</p>
    <p>I started working part time at a killer hostel, creating the experiences for others that I enjoyed so much over the last few years. In the less exciting moments, when I'm cleaning and folding linens, I listen to podcasts and stories in Spanish & Portuguese, which I continue to study.</p>
    <p>I'm putting a lot of time into my body with a focus on mobility, having strength through a range of motion, and bodyweight strength. I've been practicing at Anytime Fitness and now in my enormous bedroom where I have plenty of space to exercise, though not quite enough height for handstand training. I expect to soon join Movement Climbing & Fitness, as well as Awaken Gym.</p>
    <p>I'm still filling out 'professional' job applications, but not many. I'm happy at the hostel and don't want to leave it for a full time engineering job at the moment. Hopefully I'll be able to build up my skillset to the point where I can take on some part time or freelance programming work and start building up experience.</p>
    <!-- <p>I'm reading a bit less than I'm used to, as the books are best read in small bits at a time with reflection in between sessions. It's no coincidence that I'm walking more.</p> -->
