    <h3>Now</h3>
    <p><em>April 20, 2020</em></p>
    <p>A weekday in the life in quarantine:<br>
    Wake up, usually later than I'd like.
    Review my Anki cards for the day.
    Do some programming.
    Take a break to get outside.
    Program again.
    A lot of Dominion in the evening!
    Read a book or maybe watch a movie.
    That's about it.</p>
    <h3>Programming</h3>
    <p>Working on Slipstream from home.
    With Windows platform in Bruce's hands, I'm porting Aetria to CodeDog.
    Contributing unit tests to pyparsing on hold until my last PR is reviewed.
    Writing the documentation for ImageResizer, an Anki add-on.
    Revising documentation for various Anki add-ons.
    <br>
    I tore through a Codecademy course on the basics of C++ two weeks back.
    This week I'm going through the Khan Academy algorithms course.
    I'm still going with the LeetCode monthly challenge, though a couple of last week's prompts have been put off until I learn the relevant material (which prompted the Khan Academy course.)</p>
    <h3>Running</h3>
    <p>It's a slow, steady process building back up from nothing.
    I zig-zag around the neighborhood with the park and trails a bit crowded, usually 3-4 miles every other day.
    I'm not timing myself but I can feel my pace increasing.
    On off days I walk and stretch.</p>
    <h3>Reading</h3>
    <p>The Wheel of Time rolls on, four books in.
    It's on hold until the library reopens, tablet reading doesn't set me up well for sleep.
    I opted for The Art of Fielding last week and enjoyed the messiness and flaws of the characters.
    This week's read is still TBD.</p>
