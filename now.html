    <h3>Now</h3>
    <p><em>April 13, 2020</em></p>
    <p>A weekday in the life in quarentine:<br>
    Wake up, usually later than I'd like.
    Review my Anki cards for the day.
    Do some programming.
    Take a break to go for a run.
    Program again.
    A bit of reddit (a bit of an understatement, it's taken prime vice status lately.)
    Read a book, maybe watch a movie. (Parasite tonight.)
    That's about it.</p>
    <h3>Programming</h3>
    <p>Working on Slipstream from home.
    With Windows platform in Bruce's hands, I'm porting Aetria to CodeDog.
    Contributing unit tests to pyparsing.
    Taking over maintenance of ImageResizer, an Anki add-on.
    Revising documentation for various Anki add-ons.</p>
    <h3>Running</h3>
    <p>It's a slow, steady process building back up from nothing.
    I zig-zag around the neighborhood with the park and trails a bit crowded, usually 3-4 miles every other day.
    I'm not timing myself but I can feel my pace increasing.
    On off days I walk and stretch.</p>
    <h3>Reading</h3>
    <p>The Wheel of Time rolls on, four books in.
    It's on hold until the library reopens, tablet reading doesn't set me up well for sleep.
    The Secret History was great, next on my nightstand is The Diary of a Young Girl.</p>
